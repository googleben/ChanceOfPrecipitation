# Chance of Precipitation

Chance of Precipitation is a 2D platforming shooter made by myself and [Saif Ahmad](https://github.com/the-saif-ahmad) as the final project for my video game design class. It takes place in a levels which are procedurally generated at runtime from a set of handmade "blocks". There is a built-in editor for making these blocks. The game was originally made in XNA 4.0, but has been migrated to MonoGame since XNA has been discontinued. 

A Windows build is available in the Releases page of this repository.

## Controls

Use arrow keys, enter, and escape to navigate within menus. Ingame, use WASD+space to move and JKL; for your abilities. In the level editor left click places the selected object at your cursor, and right click removes the object.

## Building the Project

This project is configured for .NET Core 3.1, but would probably work fine with any .NET version that works with MonoGame. To build the project, just open the solution in Visual Studio 2019 or newer, ensure all NuGet packages have been downloaded, and build the solution as any other Visual Studio project.
